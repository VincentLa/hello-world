# Personal Growth
Some lessons I've learned about personal growth (especially around leadership/management)

1. In learning how to prioritize, think about importance vs urgency matrix.
2. In giving feedback to others, think about it more like helping their career, especially if negative feedback. The key is to set correct expectations up front. 
3. Often, re-framing the problem is important. For example, in an EPA call, David Hinden asked well how do these "best practices" work (for the policy practicum). Reframe it as well part of the policy practicum is to rate each of these "best practices" according to evidence base. So maybe instead of "best practices" it should be "innovation practices"
4. If there's a game of telephone (as there often is in bureacracy, just ask to be cc'd directly to follow up)
