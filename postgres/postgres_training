shared_buffers: Data is put before running a query

What exactly is an index?

pg_xlog: Journaling. In the journal you only write the instructions of how to write the file. The actual query is stored in memory when it's run. Thus, if there's a crash/memory loss, we can easily recreate what we had.

pg_stat is a catalog table with the statistics for postgres

Postgres 9.6 has parallel queries

ctid is a hidden column with block and row number.

Postgres has no lock escalation

a view, pg_locks allows you to look at current locks

There are optimistic locks which are locks that are "OK" to violate. If you hit a lock, you just try and re-run.

There is a Returning Statement

is there a difference in the types of indices?

pg_stat_statements is a view that gives you information about different queries.

insert into with exclude allows you to update insert

Bank Balance example

\set schema cloverdwh
Begin;
DROP SCHMEA IF EXISTS :schema CASCADE;
CRETE SCHEMA :schema;
SET search_path = :schema, public;

-- (1) The business problem
-- "Investigate the phenomenon of people having negative balances"
-- Fact: the bank transaction
-- Dimensions: time, account, teller -> branch

CREATE TABLE fact
(
delta integer not null,
t timestamp without time zone not null,
aid integer not null,
tid integer not null
);

CREATE TABLE diml
(
aid integer primary key,
description text
);

CREATE TABLE dim2
(
tid integer primary key,
bid integer not null,
description text
);

-- Data workflow for fact

INSERT INTO fact
select delta, mtime, aid, tid
from pgbench_history;

--Dimension modeling

INSERT INTO dim1(aid)
SELECT aid from pgbench_accounts;

INSERT INTO dim2(tid, bid)
SELECT tid, bid FROM pgbench_tellers;


COMMIT;
