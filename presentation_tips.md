# Presenting Empirical Analysis
1. Always think about what your main assumptions are and how you attempted to validate them. In particular, with empirical analysis, you are often comparing some treatment group to the control group. How have you validated that the control group is the same as the treatment group.

For example if the control group is in a different time period than the treatment group how do you know things haven't changed over time

In a business context, you're not trying to prove causality, you're trying to generate a business decision. The end state is you need yo think about what the conclusion is if you buy the assumptions, state youre conclusion if you don't. If the conclusions are the same, you're arguably done as well even if you didn't get to a perfect spot in the analysis.
