Now, imagine that we actually want to estimate what that probability will be. A naive measure could be just the currently observed proportion of heads flipped, but this can be a bad measure for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Suffers from small samples**: if we flip a coin once and flip a heads, the proportion of heads flipped is briefly 1.000, while if we flip tails, the proportion of heads flipped is 0.000.\n",

It also turns out that a really good way to represent the **prior** for the probability of heads is the *beta* distribution. The domain of the Beta distribution is (0, 1), just like a probability, so we already know we're on the right track- but the appropriateness of the Beta for this task goes far beyond that. "

We have to then update our probabilities - we want to shift this entire curve over just a bit to reflect our new information. While the math for proving this is a bit involved ([it's shown here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#Example)), the result is very simple. The **posterior** Beta distribution will be: $Beta(\\alpha_0 + successes, \\beta_0 + failures)$, where $\\alpha_0$ and $\\beta_0$ are the initial parameters for the beta distribution for the **prior**, in this case, 1 and 1 respectively."
