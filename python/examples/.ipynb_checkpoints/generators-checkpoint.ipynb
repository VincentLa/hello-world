    "Simply put, a Python iterator is any Python object that can be used with a `for` loop. Examples of python iterators are: lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. These types are iterators because they implement **iterator protocol**. In this case the iterator protocol means that two specific **magic methods** are defined:\n",
    "1. `__iter__`: this method is called on initialization of the iterator. This should return an object with a `__next__` method.\n",
    "2. `__next__`: this method is called whenever the `next()` global function is invoked with the iterator as an argument. The iterator `__next__` method returns the next value for the iterable.\n",
    "    1. When an iterator is used with a `for` loop, the for loop implicitly calls `next()` on the iterator object.\n",
    "    2. This method should raise a StopIteration exception when there is no longer any new value to return to signal the end of the iteration."
